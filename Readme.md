# Land Registry Data Importer + Junk Integration Framework

## Purpose

The Land Registry publishes it's data in CSV format, however that's not always the most useful. The importer exists to consume that CSV data, transform it an persist it in a data store.

The Junk framework facilitates this by presenting an interface that allows configuration of integration and transformation, providing standard functionality like logging, retry, file system IO, file parsing, database access.
